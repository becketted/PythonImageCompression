# PythonImageCompression
Python code developed for a coursework task to compress an image. Uses similar methods to the JPEG standard (DCT, Quantization and Run Length Encoding)
Reads in an RGB .ppm file, compresses it, writes the compressed output to file. Can then read in the compressed output and save the decompressed image.
